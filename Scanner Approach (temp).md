**Leveraging Both Carrier-First & Carrier-Last Strategies:**

Here's a breakdown of both approaches:  

Carrier First:  

Capture: This approach focuses on capturing only the carrier information (specific characteristic of the anomaly) first.  
Advantages:  
* Efficiency: Saves processing power by focusing only on potential anomalies. 
* Faster Detection: May identify anomalies quicker if the carrier is a strong indicator.  
Disadvantages:  
* Missing Context: Might miss subtle anomalies that rely on preceding data points.
* False Positives: Carriers alone might not be fully unique, leading to false flags.

Carrier Last:  

Record all prior: This approach records all data points before identifying the carrier (anomaly signature).  
Advantages:  
* More Context: Provides a richer picture for anomaly identification.
* Fewer False Positives: Context helps to differentiate true anomalies from normal variations.  
Disadvantages:  
* Processing Cost: Requires storing and analyzing all data, which can be resource-intensive.
* Delayed Detection: Anomaly identification might be slower compared to carrier-first approach.  

* **Initial Filtering:** Implement a carrier-first approach for known artificial signatures (e.g., specific malware patterns) to quickly filter them out and reduce processing overhead.
* **Contextual Analysis:**  For the remaining data, including natural anomalies, employ a carrier-last approach. Capture preceding data points for contextual analysis using techniques like:
    * **Time Series Analysis:** Identify deviations from expected patterns in the data over time.
    * **Statistical Analysis:** Use statistical methods like standard deviation to identify data points significantly different from the norm.


**Additional Considerations:**

* **Adaptive Approach:**  Develop an adaptive system that can learn from identified anomalies and update its detection methods over time, especially for handling novel natural anomalies.


___


**Lightweight Techniques:**

* **Thresholding:** Set thresholds for specific data points or features. Values exceeding or falling below the thresholds could be potential anomalies. This is simple and efficient but might miss subtle anomalies.
* **Change Point Detection:** Look for sudden shifts in the data stream. Algorithms like the CUSUM (Cumulative Sum) method can be implemented efficiently on limited resources.
* **Statistical Outliers:** Calculate basic statistics like mean and standard deviation. Data points significantly deviating from these values could be potential anomalies.

**Approaches leveraging Preset Arrays:**

* **Pre-defined Patterns:** Create an array of known artificial signature patterns. Compare incoming data points to the array for quick identification of anomalies. 
* **Sliding Window:**  Use a sliding window to store a small portion of past data. Analyze the window along with the current data point to detect anomalies based on recent trends. 

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Data Reduction:** Explore techniques to reduce data size before analysis. This could involve downsampling (reducing data points) or feature selection (focusing on relevant features).
* **Fixed-point Arithmetic:** Utilize fixed-point arithmetic instead of floating-point for calculations. This reduces processing complexity.
* **Incremental Learning:** Instead of training a complete model upfront, update a lightweight model incrementally as you encounter new data.

**Alternative Approaches:**

* **Offload Processing:** If possible, consider offloading complex analysis to a more powerful device periodically. The on-device tool can flag potential anomalies for further investigation.
* **Cloud Integration:** Explore cloud-based anomaly detection services that can analyze full data sets for a more comprehensive picture. The on-device tool can pre-filter data or trigger cloud analysis for suspicious events.

**Remember:**

* **Focus on Efficiency:** Prioritize algorithms with low computational cost and memory usage.
* **Targeted Detection:**  Instead of aiming for comprehensive anomaly detection, focus on identifying specific types of anomalies most critical for your application.
* **Trade-off Accuracy for Speed:**  Be prepared to accept a trade-off between detection accuracy and processing speed on limited resources.
